        p In many ways, the content of EE480 is very similar to that of EE380, but with one huge difference: what EE380 overviews, you will work with in-depth here, even specifying hardware implementation details to the gate level. You've no doubt heard that EE480 requires you to complete a relatively large-scale processor design project using Verilog -- yes, you will. In Spring 2016, we made a variety of significant changes to this course. Many of the changes aimed to improve the success rate of students in the class, while other were steps toward adjusting EE480 to better fit with the new curriculum structure that will be starting with the common first year for engineering. Upcoming changes affecting Computer Engineering include significant restructuring of the Sophomore year courses and making both EE380 and EE480 be required only for Computer Engineering majors... so EE380 is changing too, allowing the EE380+EE480 pair to be rebalanced to be more effective. In sum, expect EE480 in this Spring 2017 semester to be a bit of a bumpy ride as we continue to evolve this course, but know that it's because we're trying to make it a better course, and your input on how the changes work isn't just welcome -- it's critically important to us.
